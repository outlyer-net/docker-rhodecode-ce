# docker-rhodecode-ce

Docker container for the [RhodeCode](https://rhodecode.com/) Community Edition source code management platform.

RhodeCode provides Git, Subversion (svn) and Mercurial (hg) support.

## WIP

This image is based on the [previous work by darneta](https://github.com/darneta/rhodecode-ce-dockerized), updated to current versions.

**PLEASE NOTE**: I'm a new RhodeCode user so I'm still figuring out the best way to make this image work.
